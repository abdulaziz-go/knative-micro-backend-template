# Knative Template Repository

## Introduction to Knative
Knative is a Kubernetes-based platform that simplifies the deployment of serverless workloads. It provides powerful building blocks such as event-driven computing and autoscaling capabilities, making it ideal for building scalable cloud-native applications.

Key features of Knative include:
- **Knative Serving**: Run serverless containers with advanced routing, autoscaling, and rollout capabilities.
- **Knative Eventing**: Build event-driven architectures using cloud events.

This repository provides a template to quickly bootstrap Knative-based services.

## Running on local
Make sure that `func` is installed on your laptop by running the command, `func version`.

Build image:
```bash
make build-function
```

Run container: You have to give external container port for PORT parametr
```bash
make run PORT=8888
```

Stop image: 
```bash
make stop
```

You can send request to the faas in local with the url: `http://localhost:PORT/`. 

Inside the ./faas/main.go you can build another paths too. But it is only recommended for specific cases.
